        <h1>Hello Everyone, I am Michael Norberto</h1>
        <p><a href="index.html">Home Page</a>
        
        <p>I am a senior at Florida Atlantic University and I am majoring in Computer Science. I am interested in cybersecurity, A.I., neuroscience, nature, and a lot more. I am intending to graduate in May of 2022 with a degree in Computer Science, and hopefully a second one in Computer Engineering.</p>

        <p>After I graduate, I would like to get a job working with Artificial Intelligence to solve a lot of the problems of our generation. I do not have a particular preference for where, but I would love to keep working here in Palm Beach because I know the area well and I grew up here.</p>
        
        <p>I look forward to working with everyone this semester.</p>
