        <h1>Hi, I'm Robert Blanchette</h1>
        <p><a href="index.html">Home Page</a>
		<p>I am a computer science major at Florida Atlantic University. I'm interested in software development, especially of video games, and software reverse engineering. Software reverse engineering is the process of taking compiled code and attempting to determine the original code and its purpose.
		<p>After completing my degree, I hope to get a job at Raytheon or a similar company in the field of reverse engineering.
		<p>I look forward to working with everyone this semester.</p>
