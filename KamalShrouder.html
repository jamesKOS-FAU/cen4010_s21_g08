        <p>I am a junior at Florida Atlantic University and I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering. I am mainly interested in software and hardware aspects of computers and similar systems. I also have interests in things outside of my major such as music and the video game industry. My hopes are to graduate in May of 2022 with a degree in Computer Engineering, perhaps even pursuing a degree in Computer Science along the line.</p>

        <p>I'm still not sure what or where I want to work when I graduate from FAU. However, I have many different projects that I have in the works ranging from music production to my own video game. Once I have my video game in the testing phase, I will try to spread the word of it some more. For the time being, enjoy a little picture of the current cover of the game. Who knows what'll happen?</p>
        
        <p>Hopefully we can all find enjoyment in this class and semester as a whole. We can do this!</p>
