        <h1>Hi, I'm James</h1>
        <p><a href="index.html">Home</a></p>
        <p>I'm a student at Florida Atlantic University studying computer science. I previously got a bachelor's degree in music 
           from Florida State University. I am a junior and I intend to graduate in May 2022. The courses I have taken so far have
           been very interesting and I am very excited to be taking Principles of Software Engineering.</p>
        <p>Ideally, after I graduate I would like to work in software development and hopefully I am able to find a job in Palm
           Beach County since that is where I grew up and I really enjoy living here.</p>
        <p>In any event I look forward to working on our Team project this semester!</p>
